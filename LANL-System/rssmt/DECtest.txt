NMR test at UVa in December
Goal - Apple to apples comparison of Liverpool and VME systems
1. TE signal 
	Shape + width consistent?
	Background shape
	Integration of signal
	Signal to noise, for same sampling time
	Do we need to switch to FM mode? Be ready with functioning code here!
		Method - Use DAC on 2nd DAQ card
		Cable to FM input on gen
		Change Netburner code to step DAC value, neg to pos
		Change RF generator setup to FM mode insted of sweep, correct span
		Calibrate FM voltage versus freq. 800 kHz, 1 kHz steps = 10 bits,
			probably want 12 bits, OK
		FM might be better if noise is low freq, eliminated by fast scan
			Could simulate or measure noise spectrum with FFT	
Need to think a little about sampling theory
	Sampling 2 D space (F,T)
	many samples at each F versus many samples at each T or
		large F bins versus large T bins, depends on noise spectrum
		Noise will average away, but how rapidly?
		If each freq sample large enough, noise rapidly varying 
		in sample will average away		
2. Polarized signal
	Shape and width consistent?
	Absolute polarization comparison?
	Gains OK?
